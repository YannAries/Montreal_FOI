# Montr√©al_FOI - Access to Information Portal

This is a basic Django project with a theme app that plugs into [Froide](https://github.com/stefanw/froide). It's based on the [Froide Base Theme](https://github.com/okfde/froide-theme) and [UIPA.org customized theme](https://github.com/CodeforHawaii/uipa_org).

## Get started easily

Prerequisite libraries and programs:

 * libmagic (yum install libmagic, apt-get install libmagic, etc.)
 * Elasticsearch (download, unpack, and run with Java; https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)

In a Python virtualenv, run:

1. Add the --user option (if necessary) to install without needing root permissions

  ```
pip install --user -r requirements.txt -e . --src=./src
 ```

2. Upgrade pip to the latest version

 ```
pip install --upgrade pip
 ```

3. Change directory to src

 ```
cd src
```

4. Export the key into ```setting.py``` file
 
 ```
export SECRET_KEY= (name of the key)
 ```

5. Print the key
 
 ```
echo $SECRET_KEY
 ```

6. Back to the main directory
 
 ```
cd ..
 ```

07. Migrate the database and do not prompt for any input

  ```
python manage.py migrate  --noinput
  ```

08. Create a superuser

 ```
python manage.py createsuperuser
 ```

09. Load the fixtures

 ```
python manage.py loaddata uipa_org/fixtures/*
 ```

10. Compress the files

 ```
python manage.py compress
 ```

11. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser

 ```
python manage.py runserver
 ```

Be sure to remember the password for the admin user you create so that you can
log on to the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/uipa-admin/. You can
create or modify flatpages there.

### Searching for public agencies or requests

Once you have a running UIPA server, you'll want to be able to search for
public bodies or previously submitted requests for information. To so, you'll
need to:

* Dowload and install Elasticsearch
* Run an Elasticsearch server
* Build the indexes

```
python manage.py update_index
```

## Running UIPA on Heroku

There is a complete guide of how to set up Froide on Heroku at
http://froide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/herokudeployment/. For UIPA, you'll
need to interpolate a bit.


## Froide documentation

http://froide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/gettingstarted/

For details about working with Froide Themes see [Theming
Froide](http://froide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/theming/).


## Creating page content for the About, Help, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement links

Django Flat Pages are used to create these pages. They are "flat" HTML content
stored in the database. For details, see [The flatpages
app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/1.9/ref/contrib/flatpages/)
documentation.

To create these pages initially, we:

* Create the pages using the Django administration interface at
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/uipa-admin/. Click on the *Flat pages* link.
* Dump the database in JSON format (see below).
* Edit the dump file, `<db-dump>.json`.
* Copy the section of JSON data for the model, `flatpages.flatpage` (see
  below).
* Put the JSON data in a file under the uipa_org/fixtures directory named
  `flatpages.flatpage.json`.


### Loading the page data

Once the page data files have been created under the fixtures directory, they
can be loaded whenever a new instance of uipa.org is created. This is done by
loading the page data files using this command:

```
python manage.py loaddata <page>
```
where `<page>` is the name of the page data file without the `.json`
extension. Multiple pages can be loaded at the same time.


### Dumping the database

Dumping the database in JSON format is done using the command:

```
python manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 > db-dump.json
```


### Page data in JSON format

Here's an example of the page data in JSON format for the About page in the
fixtures/about-page.json:

```
[
    {
        "fields": {
            "content": "<p>UIPA.org is the place where you can request information from your State of Hawaii government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UIPA stands for Uniform Information Practices Act and is the law covered by HRS Chapter 92F.

        },
        "model": "flatpages.flatpage",
        "pk": 1
    }
]
```
